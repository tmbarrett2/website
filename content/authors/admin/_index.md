I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and a graduate research assistant in pandemic lifecycle modeling at the [Triangle Center for Evolutionary Medicine (TriCEM)](https://tricem.org/).

As an anthropologist, I am interested in how market integration influences human movement and infectious disease ecology. My dissertation work focuses on these relationships in rural northeast Madagascar, where smallholder farmers are increasingly shifting from subsistence crops to cash crops, particularly vanilla. This change has wide-ranging implications for the health of farmers and their families, and I leverage tools from network science, epidemiology, and human biology to address fundamental questions about disease ecology with an aim to inform interventions. In doing so, I draw on [One Health](https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/index.html) as an organizing framework that emphasizes the interconnections of human, animal, and environmental health.

I also take an antrhopological approach to studying chronic disease. As populations age worldwide, it is important to understand how social inequities both within and between countries drive disparities in chronic diseases of aging. I have contributed to this effort with a focus on cardiometabolic health and immune function through the analysis of data from the World Health Organization's [Study on global AGEing and adult health](https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/study-on-global-ageing-and-adult-health), the [Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey](https://cebu.cpc.unc.edu/), and the [Shuar Health and Life History Project](https://www.shuarproject.org/). Locally, at the [Duke School of Medicine](https://medschool.duke.edu/), I have studied racial and economic disparities in the treatment decision-making process among patients facing kidney failure.

You can keep up-to-date on my work by following me on Twitter or Google Scholar.
